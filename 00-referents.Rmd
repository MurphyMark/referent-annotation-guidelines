## Referents

> Annotated on tier `norm[referent]` in ExMARALDA

We have a list of 19 possible referents, and we count how many of these 20 referents each speaker introduces:

1. man (with the ball)
2. woman1 (with the stroller)
3. couple (man and woman1) - *conjoined referent*
4. family (man+woman1+baby) - *conjoined referent*
5. ball
6. stroller
7. baby
8. woman2 (with the dog)
9. dog
10. leash
11. groceries
12. trunk
13. car1 (blue one, comes in first, gets hit)
14. car2 (white one, comes in second, hits car1)
15. car3 (red one, woman with groceries)
16. cars (car1 + car2) - *conjoined referent*
17. driver1 (blue car, calls 911)
18. driver2 (white car)
19. drivers (driver1 + driver2) - *conjoined referent*

If there are [repitions](#identifying-repitions) in the narrative,
which change the referent the speaker produces, 
only referents in the final repetition should be tagged.
