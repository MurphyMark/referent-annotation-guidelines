\begin{quote}
``Assigned to referring expressions which come with a sufficient amount of descriptive material to enable the hearer to create a new discourse referent without any previous knowledge'' (p.~4).
\end{quote}

A new referent followed by explanation.
The explanation must be a part of the noun phrase containing the referent, and must include a specific non-new referent.

\begin{quote}
I saw a man and a woman.
The ball \texttt{unused-unknown} {[}that {[}the man{]} \texttt{g} was dribbling{]} \texttt{explanation} fell on the ground.
\end{quote}

Untagged referents can appear in explanations.

\begin{quote}
I was standing in the parking lot.
The two cars \texttt{unused-unkown} {[}that were coming towards me \texttt{untagged} \texttt{g} very quickly{]} \texttt{explanation} stopped abruptly.
\end{quote}

Referents preceded by possessive pronouns are also unused-unkown.
as long as the possessor is given or bridging.

\begin{quote}
I saw a man \texttt{n} with his wife \texttt{u} and her baby \texttt{u}.
\end{quote}

Referents preceded by apostrophe-s possession are \emph{also} unused-unknown -
as long as the possessor is given or bridging.

\begin{quote}
I saw a man walking down the street.
The man{[}'s wife{]} \texttt{u} was pushing a baby carriage.

\section{Bridging}\label{bridging}}

\begin{quote}
``If an entity does not have a coreferential antecedent but can be understood as unique with respect to a previously introduced situation or scenario, we will be using the label r-bridging'' (p.~4).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``This label is used for non-coreferential anaphoric expressions which are dependent on and unique with respect to a previously introduced scenario'' (p.~8).
\end{quote}

In other words, we use this tag for referents that have not been explicitly introduced but are implied as an essential part of an already known referent (the anchor).

\begin{quote}
There were two cars \texttt{n} \texttt{anchor} coming, and they crashed into each other.
The drivers \texttt{b} got out and called the police.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
There was a family \texttt{n} \texttt{anchor} walking down the street.
The father \texttt{b} was dribbling a ball.
\end{quote}

``Father'' is bridging because we know that if there is a family, there must be a father.
So, when ``father'' is introduced, you already implicitly know it's a member of that family.

The anchor need not be a tagged referent.
Any \protect\hyperlink{bridging-relationships}{bridging relationship} is enough.

\begin{quote}
I saw {[}a car crash{]} \texttt{untagged} \texttt{anchor}!
The first car \texttt{b} stopped short, and the second \texttt{b} drove into it.
\end{quote}

If a referent was bridging, you would expect it to be there, and be surprised if it did not exist.
For something that could be there, but isn't necessarily (e.g.~a woman's groceries), use the unused-unknown.

\subsection{Bridging-Contained}\label{bridging-contained}}

\begin{quote}
``This label applies to a non-coreferential anaphoric expression that is anchored to an embedded phrase'' (p.~8).
\end{quote}

Bridging-Contained is similar to Bridging, except that it requires the bridging referent to be in the same noun phrase as its anchor.

Examples:

\begin{quote}
The driver \texttt{bc} of {[}the blue car{]} \texttt{anchor} \ldots{}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The driver \texttt{bc} of {[}the closer car{]} \texttt{anchor} \ldots{}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The father \texttt{bc} of {[}the family{]} \texttt{anchor} \ldots{}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
I saw a car crash!
The driver \texttt{bc} who was in {[}the car{]} \texttt{anchor} \texttt{b} got out.
\end{quote}

Since a car is expected to have a driver,
the driver is bridging-contained.

It is possible for the anchor of a bridging relationship to be the referent in a different bridging relationship:

\begin{quote}
I saw {[}a car crash{]} \texttt{untagged} \texttt{n} \texttt{anchor:\ car1}!
The man \texttt{driver1} \texttt{bc} who was in {[}the car{]} \texttt{car1} \texttt{anchor:driver1} \texttt{b} got out.
\end{quote}

In this example, ``a car crash'' acts as an anchor for ``the car'',
which in turn acts as an anchor for ``the man''.

\hypertarget{further-explanation}{%
\section{Further-Explanation}\label{further-explanation}}

Further Explanation was brought in to solve issues like the following:

\begin{quote}
{[}Two cars{]} \texttt{cars} \texttt{n}, {[}a blue one{]} \texttt{car1} \texttt{???} and {[}a white one{]} \texttt{car2} \texttt{???}, were driving down the street.
\end{quote}

In this example, it's difficult to determine the r-type of \texttt{car1} and \texttt{car2}.
They're introduced like new referents, leading us towards \texttt{n}, but then it would seem that \texttt{car1} was introduced twice -
once in \texttt{cars}, and once in \texttt{car1}.

To resolve this, we use the \texttt{+fe} tag.
\texttt{+fe} attaches to the end of the existing annotation, and we get:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{cars} \texttt{n}
\item
  \texttt{car1} \texttt{n+fe}
\item
  \texttt{car2} \texttt{n+fe}
\end{itemize}

Theoretically, \texttt{+fe} can attach to any r-type. In practice, it is usually attached to \texttt{n}.

\begin{quote}
A dog ran into the street. The first car \texttt{n} (the blue one \texttt{n+fe}) stopped suddenly.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Two cars \texttt{cars} \texttt{n}, {[}a blue{]} \texttt{car1} \texttt{n+fe} and {[}a white one{]} \texttt{car2} \texttt{n+fe} stopped suddenly.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{predicative}{%
\section{Predicative}\label{predicative}}

Similar to Further Explanation, Predicative solves the issue with:

\begin{quote}
There was a car \texttt{car1} \texttt{n}. It looked like a blue one \texttt{car1} \texttt{???}.
\end{quote}

``a blue one'' is tagged as \texttt{car1} \texttt{pr}.

Predicative referents generally come after one of these verbs:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It was
\item
  It looked like
\item
  It seemed to be
\end{itemize}

They attribute a certain characteristic to the subject of those verbs.

Predicative referents are only tagged as \texttt{pr}

There were two cars.
The first car \texttt{g} was a blue car \texttt{g+pr}.

\begin{quote}
Annotated on the \texttt{norm\ {[}conj\_referent{]}} tier in Exmaralda
\end{quote}

Out of our 19 referents, there are 4 conjoined referents:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  couple
\item
  family
\item
  cars
\item
  drivers
\end{enumerate}

For each conjoined referent, we want to mark whether or not it is explained:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Unexplained \texttt{0}
\item
  Explained \texttt{1}
\end{itemize}

An explanation is an enumeration of conjoined referent elements with indefinite articles/possessive pronouns.
The enumeration has to come right after the conjoined referent.
Normally the explanation is separated by a comma or is in brackets.

Such explanations do not appear often, so the majority of conjoined referents will be unexplained.

Generally, members of an explained conjoined referent will be treated as \protect\hyperlink{further-explanation}{+fe}

\begin{quote}
There were two cars \texttt{cars} \texttt{n} \texttt{1}, a white one \texttt{car1} \texttt{n+fe} and a blue one \texttt{car2} \texttt{n+fe}.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
There was a family \texttt{family} \texttt{n} \texttt{1}, a mom \texttt{woman1} \texttt{n+fe}, a dad \texttt{man} \texttt{n+fe} and a baby \texttt{baby} \texttt{n+fe}.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
There was a couple \texttt{couple} \texttt{n} \texttt{0} who was crossing the road.
\end{quote}

Please note that the elements that are enumerated in the explanation should have indefinite articles. Also, the explanation should not provide any additional info about what the elements were doing. So, the following example is not an explanation:

\begin{quote}
There was a couple \texttt{couple} \texttt{n} \texttt{0}. The man was playing with a ball.

Also: if there's a man and a woman \emph{with} a baby, we treat it as a couple, as the baby is just additional information about either the man or the woman.

\begin{quote}
The first car stopped in the street.
The driver \texttt{b} got out angrily.

Since this example doesn't have ``the first car'' in the same phrase as ``the driver'', it is not Bridging-Contained.

\begin{quote}
Can a possessive pronoun give unused-unknown status to multiple coordinated referents?
\end{quote}

Yes, if the possessive pronoun applies to a coordinated noun phrase, all referents in that noun phrase are unused-unknown.

\begin{quote}
If a pronoun refers to a conjoined referent (``The two cars stopped. {[}They{]} didn't stop fast enough''),
should we mark whether or not it's explained?
\end{quote}

Yep.
It's possible, for someone to explain a conjoined referent, even if it's a pronoun, so we'll just mark all conjoined referents.

\subsection{Conjoined Referent Members}\label{conjoined-referent-members}}

\begin{quote}
When a conjoined referent appears, are members of it treated as given or bridging?
Also, when members of a conjoined referent appear, is the conjoined referent treated as given or bridging?
\end{quote}

If the conjoined referent is just the collection of individual referents, members are treated as given.
If all members have been previously listed, the conjoined referent is given, too.

Given relationship conjoined referents:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  cars
\item
  drivers
\end{itemize}

If the conjoined referent has some inferred bridging relationship between it and its members, members are treated as bridging.
If all members have been previously listed, the conjoined referent is bridging.

However, if the conjoined referent is introduced in a way that enumerates the members (``Two people were walking down the street''),
introduced members are treated as Given.

Bridging relationship conjoined referents:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  couple
\item
  family
\end{itemize}

No.
We are treating ``one behind the other'' as an idiom, so it has no referents.

\begin{quote}
What do we do with ``Either / Neither / None of the {[} conjoined referent {]}'' ?
\end{quote}

Since either, neither, and none don't really refer to a concrete referent, we will not tag the phrase,
and we will not tag any referents within the phrase.

\begin{quote}
None of the family \texttt{untagged} looked very happy.

What do we do with ``Both of the {[} conjoined referent {]}'' ?

This phrase refers to the conjoined referent. Tag the whole phrase, and tag it with whatever the conjoined referent would be on its own.

\begin{quote}
The two cars stopped.
{[}Both of the drivers{]} \texttt{drivers} \texttt{b} got out.

\begin{quote}
What do we do with ``One of the {[}conjoined referent{]}'' ?
\end{quote}

This phrase refers to a single member of the conjoined referent.
If the context gives evidence that it is one or the other of the members, tag the whole phrase as that member.

If there is no evidence to the identity of the referent, treat it like other ambiguous referents, and do not tag it.

\begin{quote}
The white car \texttt{g} crashed into the blue car \texttt{g}.
One of the drivers \texttt{driver} \texttt{b} got out and called the police.
\end{quote}

We know that the referent is driver1, because driver1 is the one who calls the police in this scenario.
We know that the referent is bridging, because driver1 has a bridging relationship with the blue car.

\begin{quote}
The two drivers \texttt{g} crashed into each other.
One of them \texttt{untagged} looked upset.
\end{quote}

Both drivers could be described as looking upset.
Since we don't know which driver the phrase refers to, we don't tag anything in the phrase.

\end{quote}

An r-type is \texttt{-Displaced} if there are 5 CU's \emph{between} the CU containing the referent and the CU containing its most recent co-referent/anchor.

The count of CU's should exclude \href{empty-cu's}{empty CU's}.

\hypertarget{empty-cus}{%

Introductions appear at the beginning of narratives.
The speaker introduces the main events of the narrative,
before going back and explaining more in-depth.

\begin{quote}
Oh my gosh I just saw this car crash!
A man and a woman were walking\ldots{}
\end{quote}

Introductions can identified by two main factors:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  They summarize a portion of the later narrative
\item
  They are temporally displaced - after the introduction,
  the speaker moves to a different time in the story's narrative.

\subsection{Aposotrophe S}\label{aposotrophe-s}}

\begin{quote}
What do we do with 's phrases, like ``the man's ball''?
\end{quote}

Normally when you see an apostrophe s, you can break the phrase up into a given and an unused-unknown.

However, if there is a \protect\hyperlink{bridging-relationships}{bridging relationship} between the two members of the phrase, the second member might be bridging-contained instead.
This requires a bridging relationship, though, and most apostrophe s's will be unused-unknown.

Additionally, if the possessor of the phrase is New,
the possessed referent is also New.

\subsection{Possessive Pronouns}\label{possessive-pronouns}}

\begin{quote}
What do we do with phrases containing possessive pronouns (his ball)?
\end{quote}

Possessive pronoun phrases are either unused-unknown or bridging (never bridging-contained).
If there is a bridging relationship, then bridging. Otherwise unused-unknown.

\begin{quote}
A woman was in the parking lot.
{[}Her groceries{]} \texttt{u} fell.

Nope! Only personal pronouns and referent phrases should be tagged.

He \texttt{g} was happy.
