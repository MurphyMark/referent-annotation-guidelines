We use the ReFlex annotation scheme to give each new referent a referential label.
The original ReFlex paper can be found at \url{https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/9028}.

We use the following 7 labels:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
& R-Type & Abbreviation\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
1 & New & \texttt{n}\tabularnewline
2 & Unused-Unknown & \texttt{u}\tabularnewline
3 & Bridging & \texttt{b}\tabularnewline
4 & Bridging-Contained & \texttt{bc}\tabularnewline
5 & Bridging-Displaced & \texttt{bd}\tabularnewline
6 & Given & \texttt{g}\tabularnewline
7 & Given-Displaced & \texttt{gd}\tabularnewline

\hypertarget{new}{%
\section{New}\label{new}}

A regular new referent, normally introduced with an indefinite article, referential ``this'', or a numeral.

\begin{quote}
I saw {[}this man{]} \texttt{new} walking down the street and {[}a woman{]} \texttt{new} with a stroller.
There were also {[}two cars{]} \texttt{new} coming.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
A woman \texttt{new} with a black dog \texttt{new} was loading groceries \texttt{new} into a minivan \texttt{new}.

\hypertarget{unused-unknown}{%
\section{Unused-Unknown}\label{unused-unknown}}

\begin{quote}
``Assigned to referring expressions which come with a sufficient amount of descriptive material to enable the hearer to create a new discourse referent without any previous knowledge'' (p.~4).
\end{quote}

A new referent followed by explanation.
The explanation must be a part of the noun phrase containing the referent, and must include a specific non-new referent.

\begin{quote}
I saw a man and a woman.
The ball \texttt{unused-unknown} that the man was dribbling fell on the ground.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
I was standing in the parking lot.
The two cars \texttt{unused-unkown} that were coming towards me stopped abruptly.
\end{quote}

Referents preceded by possessive pronouns are also unused-unkown.

\begin{quote}
I saw a man \texttt{new} with his wife \texttt{unused-unknown} and her baby \texttt{unused-unknown}.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{bridging}{%
\section{Bridging}\label{bridging}}

\begin{quote}
``If an entity does not have a coreferential antecedent but can be understood as unique with respect to a previously introduced situation or scenario, we will be using the label r-bridging'' (p.~4).
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``This label is used for non-coreferential anaphoric expressions which are dependent on and unique with respect to a previously introduced scenario'' (p.~8).
\end{quote}

In other words, we use this tag for referents that have not been explicitly introduced but are implied as an essential part of an already known referent (the anchor).

If a referent was bridging, you would expect it to be there, and be surprised if it did not exist.
For something that could be there, but isn't necessarily (e.g.~a woman's groceries), use the unused-unknown.

\begin{quote}
There were two cars \texttt{new} coming, and they crashed into each other.
The drivers \texttt{bridging} got out and called the police.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
There was a family \texttt{new} walking down the street.
The father \texttt{bridging} was dribbling a ball.
\end{quote}

``Father'' is bridging because we know that if there is a family, there must be a father.
So, when ``father'' is introduced, you already implicitly know it's a member of that family.

\begin{quote}
I saw a car crash! The first car \texttt{bridging} stopped short, and the second \texttt{bridging} drove into it.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Bridging-Contained}\label{bridging-contained}}

\begin{quote}
``This label applies to a non-coreferential anaphoric expression that is anchored to an embedded phrase'' (p.~8).
\end{quote}

Briding-Contained is similar to Unused-Unknown, except that it requires the anchor of a bridging relationship in the same phrase, not just an introduced referent.

Examples:

\begin{quote}
The driver \texttt{bc} of the blue car \ldots{}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The driver \texttt{bc} of the closer car \ldots{}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The father \texttt{bc} of the family \ldots{}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
I saw a car crash! The driver \texttt{bc} who was in the car \texttt{b} got out.
\end{quote}

Since a car is expected to have a driver, the driver is bridging-contained.

\begin{quote}
I saw a car crash! The man \texttt{bc} who was in the car \texttt{b} got out.

A Bridging-Displaced referent is a Bridging referent with 5 non-empty CU's between the CU containing the referent and the most recent CU containing its anchor.

There was a couple \ldots{}
{[}5 CU's{]} \ldots{}

Questions:

\hypertarget{given}{%

A given referent is one that has been previously introduced, either as itself, or as part of a given-relationship conjoined referent.

\begin{quote}
There was a man.
He \texttt{g} was dribbling a ball.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
There were these two people walking.
One \texttt{g} of them had a ball.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
There were two cars approaching the scene.
The first car \texttt{given} stopped, and the second car \texttt{given} bumped into it.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}

\begin{quote}
A woman was closing {[}her trunk{]}, opening {[}it{]}, and \ldots{}
\end{quote}

Tag both referents normally.

\begin{quote}
The car behind him - hit {[}it{]} also - hit {[}the car{]} - {[}the other car{]}
\end{quote}

Tag only ``the other car''.

Tag only the second ``the ball''.

\begin{quote}
How confusing can a description be before we decide not to tag the referent?
\end{quote}

Here are some examples, and our decisions.
The referents in question are marked with \texttt{{[}{]}} brackets:

\begin{quote}
I saw a lady, and {[}a boy{]} next to her bouncing a ball.
\end{quote}

\texttt{man} - \texttt{u}

\begin{quote}
\ldots{} so the {[}owner{]} of {[}the cars{]} called 911.
\end{quote}

Neither is tagged, because there is no single owner of two cars.

\begin{quote}
The two people came out of their cars and {[}a man{]} with the white shirt called the police.
\end{quote}

\texttt{driver} - \texttt{g}

{[}They{]} both came out, and {[}one of them{]} called the police
\end{quote}

``They'': \texttt{drivers} - \texttt{g}

``One of them'': \texttt{driver1} - \texttt{g}

\begin{quote}

  There is a non-annotated referent that has been previously introduced

Phrase: ``who was holding the ball''

``the ball'': Given

Phrase contains a given referent

\begin{quote}
The man who was holding a ball \texttt{n} dropped it.

Phrase: ``who was holding a ball''

``a ball'': New

Phrase does not contain a given referent

\begin{quote}
The man with the woman \texttt{g} 's ball \texttt{u} dropped it.
\end{quote}

Phrase: ``with the woman's ball''

``the woman'': Given

``'s ball'': Unused-Unknown

Phrase contains a given referent

\begin{quote}
A couple was walking down the road.
A woman across the street was unloading groceries from her car.

Phrase: ``across the street''

``the street'': Given

Phrase contains a given referent

Note: Although ``the street'' is not annotated, it has been introduced in the narrative.
So, it is considered a given referent.
