### New vs. Unused-Unknown

> Should I tag this referent as New or Unused-Unknown?

Tag as `u` if:

<!-- TODO: predicate? How to call the other parts of NP? -->
<!-- TODO: How to call previously-introduced referents? -->
* The predicate contains a [given referent](#phrases-containing-given-referents)
* The predicate contains a bridging or unused-unknown referent

<!-- TODO: tag 'the back of the car' as u -->
<!-- TODO: Tag "the woman's dog" as u -->

Otherwise, tag as `n`.

### Phrases Containing Given Referents

<!-- TODO: Name, update links -->

> Does this phrase contain a given referent?

A phrase contains a given referent if:

* There is an annotated referent marked `g`

* There is a non-annotated referent that has been previously introduced

Examples:

<!--
* `g` referent => Y
* `n` referent => N
* `u` referent => N
* given un-annotated => Y
* non-given un-annotated => N

Phrase types:
* relative clause
* prepositional phrase

<!-- TODO: Possessive phrase phrasing -->
Simalar to [unused-unknown](#new-vs.-unused-unknown), tag as `bc` if:

* The referent is a part of a possessive phrase with the anchor
