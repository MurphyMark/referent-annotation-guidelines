# Questions & Answers

## Referents

### Groceries

> What phrases should we tag as `groceries`? What phrases should we not?

Generally, `groceries` should be a mass noun.
Here's a list of things we've decided to tag as `groceries`, and a list of things we've decided not to.

Groceries:

* groceries
* produce
* shopping
* stuff
* food

Not Groceries:

* bags
* baggage
* fruits

### Family vs. Couple

> Is this group of people `family` or `couple` ?

Generally, if all the members of the family have been introduced, they refers to the family.
If only man and woman1 (and maybe stroller) have been introduced, they refers to the couple, instead.

Also: if there’s a man and a woman *with* a baby, we treat it as a couple, as the baby is just additional information about either the man or the woman.

> There was a man, a woman, and a baby.
> They `family` crossed the street.

> There was a man and a woman.
> They `couple` crossed the street.

> There was a man and a woman and a stroller.
> They `couple` went across the street.

> There was a man and a woman with a baby.
> They `couple` crossed the street. 

### Possessive Pronoun "whose"

> How do we tag "whose" in referent noun phrases such as "There was a woman whose car ..."

Tag "whose" as part of the referent that comes after.

> There was a woman [whose car] `u` was very spacious.

### Repititions

> What do we do with repeated references ("A ball - a ball was rolling ...")?

If a referent was repeated, tag only the last referent - the one the speaker eventually decided on.

> A man `untagged` was, a man `n` was walking down the street.

### Identifying Repititions

<!-- Add to 00-referents -->
> Does this example contain a repitition?

Here are some previous questions about repitions, and our decisions.
The referents in question are marked with `[]` brackets:

> A woman was closing [her trunk], opening [it], and ...

Tag both referents normally.

> The car behind him - hit [it] also - hit [the car] - [the other car]

Tag only "the other car".

> And the guy with [the ball] who accidentally dropped [the ball] ...

Tag only the second "the ball".

### Tagging Unclear Referents

<!-- Add to 00-referents -->
> How confusing can a description be before we decide not to tag the referent?

Here are some examples, and our decisions.
The referents in question are marked with `[]` brackets:

> I saw a lady, and [a boy] next to her bouncing a ball.

`man` - `u`

> ... so the [owner] of [the cars] called 911.

Neither is tagged, because there is no single owner of two cars.

> The two people came out of their cars and [a man] with the white shirt called the police.

`driver` - `g`

> [They] both came out, and [one of them] called the police

"They": `drivers` - `g`

"One of them": `driver1` - `g`

> I think [someone] like called 911

`drivers`

> The man helped the woman. Uh, [she] helped her pick up her groceries.

`man`

> ... which distracted a dog that was in the road behind [a car].

Untagged

> [The passengers] got out and called the police.

Untagged

> The car behind him was coming after him, so [he] crashed into [that car] too.

Both untagged

### Generic Referents

> Is this referent generic, and should we tag it?

Here are some examples, and our decisions:

<!-- Copy to dog => leash bridging -->
> The woman was holding her dog by [the leash].

`leash` - `b`

> Both drivers got out of [the car]

Untagged

### Aposotrophe S

> What do we do with 's phrases, like "the man's ball"?

Normally when you see an apostrophe s, you can break the phrase up into a given and an unused-unknown.

However, if there is a bridging relationship between the two members of the phrase, the second member might be bridging-contained instead.
This requires a bridging relationship, though, and most apostrophe s’s will be unused-unknown.

> A woman was getting her groceries. 
> The woman `g` [‘s dog] `u` ran into the road.

> A car pulled over.
> The car `g` [‘s driver] `bc` got out, and started yelling.
        
### Possessive Pronouns

> What do we do with phrases containing possessive pronouns (his ball)?

Possessive pronoun phrases are either unused-unknown or bridging (never bridging-contained).
If there is a bridging relationship, then bridging. Otherwise unused-unknown.

> A woman was in the parking lot.
> [Her groceries] `u` fell.

> One of the drivers stopped suddenly.
> [ Their car ] `b` screeched really loud.

### Wh-Words and Possessive Pronouns

> Should we tag wh-words or possessive pronouns that are not attached to a referent?

Nope! Only personal pronouns and referent phrases should be tagged.

> A man `n` was in the parking lot.
> He `g` was happy.

> A man `n` was in the parking lot.
> In his `untagged` hand was [his ball] `u`.

> There was a woman.
> The man `u` who `untagged` was with her looked confused.

### Conjoined Referents

> When a conjoined referent appears, are members of it treated as given or bridging?
> Also, when members of a conjoined referent appear, is the conjoined referent treated as given or bridging?

If the conjoined referent is just the collection of individual referents, members are treated as given. 
If all members have been previously listed, the conjoined referent is given, too.

Given relationship conjoined referents:

* cars
* drivers

If the conjoined referent has some inferred bridging relationship between it and its members, members are treated as bridging.
If all members have been previously listed, the conjoined referent is bridging.

However, if the conjoined referent is introduced in a way that enumerates the members ("Two people were walking down the street"),
introduced members are treated as Given.

Bridging relationship conjoined referents:

* couple
* family

## R-Types

### New vs. Unused-Unknown

> Should I tag this referent as New or Unused-Unknown?

Tag as `u` if:

<!-- TODO: predicate? How to call the other parts of NP? -->
<!-- TODO: How to call previously-introduced referents? -->
* The predicate contains a [given referent](#phrases-containing-given-referents)
* The predicate contains a bridging or unused-unknown referent

<!-- TODO: tag 'the back of the car' as u -->
<!-- TODO: Tag "the woman's dog" as u -->

Otherwise, tag as `n`.

<!-- TODO: Examples -->


### Phrases Containing Given Referents

<!-- TODO: Name, update links -->

> Does this phrase contain a given referent?

A phrase contains a given referent if:

* There is an annotated referent marked `g`

* There is a non-annotated referent that has been previously introduced

Examples:

<!--
* `g` referent => Y
* `n` referent => N
* `u` referent => N
* given un-annotated => Y
* non-given un-annotated => N

Phrase types:
* relative clause
* prepositional phrase
-->

<!-- TODO: Other phrase types ? -->

> The man who was holding the ball `g` and talking to a woman dropped it.

Phrase: "who was holding the ball"

"the ball": Given

"a woman": New

Phrase contains a given referent

> The man who was holding a ball `n` dropped it.

Phrase: "who was holding a ball"

"a ball": New

Phrase does not contain a given referent

<!-- TODO: "The man who was holding the woman's ball -->
> The man with the woman `g` 's ball `u` dropped it.

Phrase: "with the woman's ball"

"the woman": Given

"'s ball": Unused-Unknown

Phrase contains a given referent

<!-- TODO: Does sidewalk == street? -->

> A couple was walking down the road.
> A woman across the street was unloading groceries from her car.

Phrase: "across the street"

"the street": Given

Phrase contains a given referent

Note: Although "the street" is not annotated, it has been introduced in the narrative.
So, it is considered a given referent.

> A couple was walking with a stroller.
> A woman across the street was unloading groceries from her car.

Phrase: "across the street"

"the street": New

Phrase does not contain a given referent

### Bridging vs. Bridging-Contained

> Should I tag this referent as Bridging or Bridging-Contained?

<!-- TODO: Link `anchor` -->
<!-- TODO: Possessive phrase phrasing -->
Simalar to [unused-unknown](#new-vs.-unused-unknown), tag as `bc` if either:

* The anchor of the referent appears in the same phrase as the referent
* The referent is a part of a possessive phrase with the anchor

> A child was walking down the street.
> The father `bc` of the child was following close behind.

> Two cars stopped in the street.
> The first car ['s driver] `bc` got out angrily.

> The first car stopped in the street.
> The driver `b` got out angrily.

Since this example doesn't have "the first car" in the same phrase as "the driver", it is not Bridging-Contained.

<!-- TODO: Examples -->

### Possessive Pronoun Multiple Referents

<!-- link possessive-pronoun & unused-unknown -->
> Can a possessive pronoun give unused-unknown status to multiple coordinated referents?

Yes, if the possessive pronoun applies to a coordinated noun phrase, all referents in that noun phrase are unused-unknown.

> There was a woman with [her dog] `u` and [groceries] `u`.


### Counting CU's

> How do we count the 5 CU's between a referent and its most recent co-referent/anchor

An r-type is `-Displaced` if there are 5 CU's *between* the CU containing the referent and the CU containing its most recent co-referent/anchor.

The count of CU's should exclude [empty CU's](empty-cu's).

### Empty CU's

> Which CU's are empty CU's?

Empty CU's are those without words - pauses, tongue clicks, gulping, etc.

<!-- TODO: Add examples -->
<!-- TODO: What about "hmm" -->

## Conjoined Referents

### Explaining Conjoined Referent Pronouns

> If a pronoun refers to a conjoined referent ("The two cars stopped. [They] didn't stop fast enough"),
> should we mark whether or not it’s explained?

Yep.
It’s possible, for someone to explain a conjoined referent, even if it’s a pronoun, so we’ll just mark all conjoined referents.

> There was a family walking down the street.
> They `family` `g` `1`, a man, a woman, and a child, were walking quickly.

## Phrases

### One Behind The Other

> Does thre phrase "one behind the other" have any referents?

No.
We are treating "one behind the other" as an idiom, so it has no referents.


### Everyone

> Which referent does "everyone" refer to?

Here are some previous questions about "everyone", and our decisions:

> The car hit into the back of another car. 
> [Everyone] seemed fine.

Untagged

> The man checked with [everyone] involved in the accident.

`drivers`

<!-- Get context -->
> [Everybody] got out and [they] were talking.

`drivers` for both

<!-- Get context -->
> ... then [everybody] got out and was yelling.

`drivers`

### Either/Neither/None of the

> What do we do with "Either / Neither / None of the [ conjoined referent ]" ?


Since either, neither, and none don’t really refer to a concrete referent, we will not tag the phrase,
and we will not tag any referents within the phrase.


> None of the family `untagged` looked very happy.

> Neither of the drivers `untagged` was at fault.

> Either one of them `untagged` could have ended the fight.

### Both of the

What do we do with "Both of the [ conjoined referent ]" ?

This phrase refers to the conjoined referent. Tag the whole phrase, and tag it with whatever the conjoined referent would be on its own.

> The two cars stopped.
> [Both of the drivers] `drivers` `b` got out.

> [Both of the people] `couple` `u` who had been walking down the street looked shocked.

### One of the

> What do we do with "One of the [conjoined referent]" ?

This phrase refers to a single member of the conjoined referent.
If the context gives evidence that it is one or the other of the members, tag the whole phrase as that member.

If there is no evidence to the identity of the referent, treat it like other ambiguous referents, and do not tag it.

> The white car `g` crashed into the blue car `g`.
> One of the drivers `driver` `b` got out and called the police.

We know that the referent is driver1, because driver1 is the one who calls the police in this scenario.
We know that the referent is bridging, because driver1 has a bridging relationship with the blue car.

> The two drivers `g` crashed into each other.
> One of them `untagged` looked upset.

Both drivers could be described as looking upset.
Since we don’t know which driver the phrase refers to, we don’t tag anything in the phrase.

### Each Other

> Should we tag "each other" ?

Nope.

## Technical

### Hide Tiers

> EXMARaLDA has too many tiers. Can I hide some?

Yes! To hide tiers in Exmaralda, without deleting them:

* Select a tier on the left, or use shift-click to select multiple tiers
* In the top menu, go to Tier > Hide Tier

### Merge Cells

> Is there a way to merge cells and immediately begin typing?

Yes.
If you use the merge-cells button, you have to click on the merged cell to type into it.
However, if you instead use the merge-cells shortcut (ctrl-1 on Windows), you can immediately begin typing in the merged cell.
