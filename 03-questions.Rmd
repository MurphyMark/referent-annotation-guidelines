# Questions & Answers

## Referents

### Possessive Pronoun "whose"

> How do we tag "whose" in referent noun phrases such as "There was a woman whose car ..."

Tag "whose" as part of the referent that comes after.

> There was a woman [whose car] `u` was very spacious.

### Identifying Repititions

<!-- Add to 00-referents -->
> Does this example contain a repitition?

Here are some previous questions about repitions, and our decisions.
The referents in question are marked with `[]` brackets:

> A woman was closing [her trunk], opening [it], and ...

Tag both referents normally.

> The car behind him - hit [it] also - hit [the car] - [the other car]

Tag only "the other car".

> And the guy with [the ball] who accidentally dropped [the ball] ...

Tag only the second "the ball".

### Tagging Unclear Referents

<!-- Add to 00-referents -->
> How confusing can a description be before we decide not to tag the referent?

Here are some examples, and our decisions.
The referents in question are marked with `[]` brackets:

> I saw a lady, and [a boy] next to her bouncing a ball.

`man` - `u`

> ... so the [owner] of [the cars] called 911.

Neither is tagged, because there is no single owner of two cars.

> The two people came out of their cars and [a man] with the white shirt called the police.

`driver` - `g`

> [They] both came out, and [one of them] called the police

"They": `drivers` - `g`

"One of them": `driver1` - `g`

> I think [someone] like called 911

`drivers`

> The man helped the woman. Uh, [she] helped her pick up her groceries.

`man`

> ... which distracted a dog that was in the road behind [a car].

Untagged

> [The passengers] got out and called the police.

Untagged

> The car behind him was coming after him, so [he] crashed into [that car] too.

Both untagged

## R-Types

### New vs. Unused-Unknown

> Should I tag this referent as New or Unused-Unknown?

Tag as `u` if:

<!-- TODO: predicate? How to call the other parts of NP? -->
<!-- TODO: How to call previously-introduced referents? -->
* The predicate contains a [given referent](#phrases-containing-given-referents)
* The predicate contains a bridging or unused-unknown referent

<!-- TODO: tag 'the back of the car' as u -->
<!-- TODO: Tag "the woman's dog" as u -->

Otherwise, tag as `n`.

### Phrases Containing Given Referents

<!-- TODO: Name, update links -->

> Does this phrase contain a given referent?

A phrase contains a given referent if:

* There is an annotated referent marked `g`

* There is a non-annotated referent that has been previously introduced

Examples:

<!--
* `g` referent => Y
* `n` referent => N
* `u` referent => N
* given un-annotated => Y
* non-given un-annotated => N

Phrase types:
* relative clause
* prepositional phrase
-->

<!-- TODO: Other phrase types ? -->

> The man who was holding the ball `g` and talking to a woman dropped it.

Phrase: "who was holding the ball"

"the ball": Given

"a woman": New

Phrase contains a given referent

> The man who was holding a ball `n` dropped it.

Phrase: "who was holding a ball"

"a ball": New

Phrase does not contain a given referent

<!-- TODO: "The man who was holding the woman's ball -->
> The man with the woman `g` 's ball `u` dropped it.

Phrase: "with the woman's ball"

"the woman": Given

"'s ball": Unused-Unknown

Phrase contains a given referent

<!-- TODO: Does sidewalk == street? -->

> A couple was walking down the road.
> A woman across the street was unloading groceries from her car.

Phrase: "across the street"

"the street": Given

Phrase contains a given referent

Note: Although "the street" is not annotated, it has been introduced in the narrative.
So, it is considered a given referent.

> A couple was walking with a stroller.
> A woman across the street was unloading groceries from her car.

Phrase: "across the street"

"the street": New

Phrase does not contain a given referent

### Bridging vs. Bridging-Contained

> Should I tag this referent as Bridging or Bridging-Contained?

<!-- TODO: "predicate" ? -->
<!-- TODO: Link `anchor` -->
<!-- TODO: Possessive phrase phrasing -->
Simalar to [unused-unknown](#new-vs.-unused-unknown), tag as `bc` if:

* The anchor of the referent appears in the predicate

* The referent is a part of a possessive phrase with the anchor

#### Examples
<!-- TODO: Examples -->

### Possessive Pronoun Multiple Referents

<!-- link possessive-pronoun & unused-unknown -->
> Can a possessive pronoun give unused-unknown status to multiple coordinated referents?

Yes, if the possessive pronoun applies to a coordinated noun phrase, all referents in that noun phrase are unused-unknown.

> There was a woman with [her dog] `u` and [groceries] `u`.


### Counting CU's

> How do we count the 5 CU's between a referent and its most recent co-referent/anchor

An r-type is `-Displaced` if there are 5 CU's *between* the CU containing the referent and the CU containing its most recent co-referent/anchor.

The count of CU's should exclude [empty CU's](empty-cu's).

### Empty CU's

> Which CU's are empty CU's?

Empty CU's are those without words - pauses, tongue clicks, gulping, etc.
