> Annotated on tier `norm[r-type]` in ExMARALDA

We use the ReFlex annotation scheme to give each new referent a referential label.
The original ReFlex paper can be found at https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/9028.

We use the following 9 labels:

| | R-Type | Abbreviation
|:-|-|-|
| 1 | New | `n` |
| 2 | Unused-Unknown | `u` |
| 3 | Bridging | `b` |
| 4 | Bridging-Contained | `bc` |
| 5 | Bridging-Displaced | `bd` |
| 6 | Given | `g` |
| 7 | Given-Displaced | `gd` |
| (8) | Further-Explanation | `+fe` |
| (9) | Predicative | `pr` |

## New

A regular new referent, normally introduced with an indefinite article, referential "this", or a numeral.

> I saw [this man] `n` walking down the street and [a woman] `new` with a stroller.
> There were also [two cars] `n` coming.

> A woman `n` with a black dog `n` was loading groceries `n` into a minivan `n`.

## Unused-Unknown

> “Assigned to referring expressions which come with a sufficient amount of descriptive material to enable the hearer to create a new discourse referent without any previous knowledge” (p. 4).

A new referent followed by an indentifying explanation.
The explanation must be a part of the noun phrase containing the referent, and must include another given/bridging/unused-unknown referent.

[More information on identifying explanations](#referent-explanations).

> Across the street, a dog was barking.
> The woman `u` [with the dog] `explanation` yelled at it.

> I saw a man and a woman.
> The ball `u` [that [the man] `g` was dribbling] `explanation` fell on the ground.

Untagged referents can appear in explanations.

> I was standing in the parking lot.
> The two cars `unused-unkown` [that were coming towards me `untagged` `g` very quickly] `explanation` stopped abruptly.

Referents preceded by possessive pronouns are also unused-unknown,
as long as the possessor is given or bridging.

> I saw a man `n` with his wife `u` and their baby `u`.

Referents preceded by apostrophe-s possession are *also* unused-unknown -
as long as the possessor is given or bridging.

> I saw a man walking down the street.
> The man['s wife] `u` was pushing a baby carriage.

> There was a car on the other side of the parking lot.
> A woman['s dog] `n` was barking loudly.

Note:
If a given referent is referred to in a way that appears
unused-unknown, it should still be tagged `g` 
because once the referent is given, it cannot go back to unused-unknown.

> A man was walking down the street and bouncing a ball.
> ...
> The man `g`, not `u` with the ball stopped bouncing it.

## Bridging

> “If an entity does not have a coreferential antecedent but can be understood as unique with respect to a previously introduced situation or scenario, we will be using the label r-bridging” (p. 4).

> “This label is used for non-coreferential anaphoric expressions which are dependent on and unique with respect to a previously introduced scenario” (p. 8).

We use this tag for referents that have not been explicitly introduced but are implied as an essential part of an already known referent (the anchor).

When the anchor of a bridging referent has been introduced,
the listener expects that referent to appear,
and would not be surprised if it was introduced without explanation.

> There were two cars `n` `anchor` coming, and they crashed into each other.
> The drivers `b` got out and called the police.

> There was a family `n` `anchor` walking down the street.
> The father `b` was dribbling a ball.

"Drivers" are bridging from "cars" because we know that cars normally have drivers.
So, when you see "the drivers", you immediately understand that they are the drivers of the two cars.

Similarly, "father" is bridging from "family" because we know that if there is a family, there must be a father.
So, when "father" is introduced, you already implicitly know it's a member of that family.

The anchor and the referent should have a 
[bridging relationship](#bridging relationship) between them.
However, the anchor does not need to be a tagged referent.
Any bridging relationship is enough.

> I saw [a car crash] `untagged` `anchor`!
> The first car `b` stopped short, and the second `b` drove into it.

Note 1:
The bridging referent can sometimes be directly introduced with a pronoun.
This is very common with `drivers`.
In this case, the pronoun should still be treated as bridging.

> The first car `car1` `g` stopped suddenly.
> The car behind didn’t brake in time and hit him `driver1` `b`.

Note 2: 
Bridging relationships do not *always* mean that
referents should be tagged `b`.
If referents are introduced 
in a way that does not reflect the relationship,
they should be tagged as `g` instead.

> A man `man` and a woman `woman1` were walking down the street.
> The two people `couple` `g` 
> were pushing a baby carriage and bouncing a ball.

This happens commonly when referring to `couple` as "two people",
or to `family` as "the three people".

Note 3:
If an anchor is introduced 
in a way that does not show a bridging relationship ("two people"),
but then a referent is introduced 
that only makes sense with a bridging relationship ("the husband"),
that referent should be marked as new.
Consider the following example:

> Two people `couple` `n` were walking down the street.
> The husband `man` `n` was bouncing a ball.

There's no reason that "two people" must include a husband,
so it's not expected in the way that a bridging referent must be.

> Two people `couple` `n` were walking down the street.
> The man `man` `n` was bouncing a ball.

Similar to "husband",
there's no expectation that a group of two people includes a man.

Note 4:
If a given referent is referred to in a way that appears
bridging, it should still be tagged `g` 
because once the referent is given, it cannot go back to bridging.

> Two cars were driving down the street.
> The drivers were clearly speeding `b`.
> The driver `g`, not `b` of the first car stopped suddenly.

### Bridging-Contained

> "This label applies to a non-coreferential anaphoric expression that is anchored to an embedded phrase” (p. 8).

<!-- TODO: Link to Anchor -->
<!-- TODO: Link bridging relationship -->

Bridging-Contained is similar to Bridging, except that it requires the bridging referent to be in the same noun phrase as its anchor.

Examples:

> The driver `bc` of [the blue car] `anchor` ...

> The driver `bc` of [the closer car] `anchor` ...

> The father `bc` of [the family] `anchor` ...

Since a car is expected to have a driver, and a family to have a father, 
the driver and the father are bridging-contained.

It is possible for the anchor of a bridging-contaied relationship to be the referent in a different bridging relationship
with a different anchor:

> I saw [a car crash] `untagged` `n` `anchor: car1`!
> The man `driver1` `bc` who was in [the car] `car1` `anchor:driver1` `b` got out. 

In this example, "a car crash" acts as an anchor for "the car",
which in turn acts as an anchor for "the man".

### Bridging-Displaced

A Bridging-Displaced referent is a Bridging referent with 5 non-empty CU's between the CU containing the referent and the most recent CU containing its anchor.

> There was a couple `couple` `n` ... 
> [5 CU's] ... 
> The mother `woman1` `bd` was just standing there and didn't do anything

> A family `family` `n` was walking down the street.
> On the other side of the road, there was a woman.
> She was taking groceries out of her car.
> She was holding a dog on a leash.
> The dog saw a ball that rolled into the street.
> It barked and chased after the ball.
> The father `man` `bd` yelled and tried to stop the dog.

## Given

A given referent is one that has been previously introduced.
It could be introduced either as itself (`man`),
or as part of a conjoined referent without a [bridging relationship](#bridging-relationships) 
(`two people` `n` - `first person` `g`, `two cars` `n` - `the first car` `g`), 
or through the enumeration of its elements (`a man` `n` and `a woman` `n` - `the two people` `g`).

> There was a man `man`.
> He `man` `g` was dribbling a ball.

> There were these two people `couple` walking.
> One of them `man` `g` had a ball.

> There were two cars `cars` approaching the scene.
> The first car `car1` `g` stopped, and the second car `car2` `g` bumped into it.

> The drivers `drivers` of the two cars stopped suddenly.
> The first one `driver1` `g` got out and called the police,
> and the second one `driver2` `g` started yelling.

> There was a man `man` who was dribbling a ball and a woman `woman1` with a stroller.
> The two people `couple` `g` were crossing the street.

> There were two people `couple` crossing the street.
> The first person `man` `g` was bouncing a ball,
> and the second `woman1` `g` was pushing a stroller.

### Given-Displaced

A Given-Displaced referent is a Given referent with 5 non-empty CU's between the CU containing the referent and the most recent CU containing the same referent.

## Further-Explanation

Further Explanation was brought in to solve issues like the following:

> [Two cars] `cars` `n`, [a blue one] `car1` `???` and [a white one] `car2` `???`, were driving down the street.

In this example, it's difficult to determine the r-type of `car1` and `car2`.
They're introduced like new referents, leading us towards `n`, but then it would seem that `car1` was introduced twice -
once in `cars`, and once in `car1`.

To resolve this, we use the `+fe` tag.
`+fe` attaches to the end of the existing annotation, and we get:

* `cars` `n`
* `car1` `n+fe`
* `car2` `n+fe`

Theoretically, `+fe` can attach to any r-type. In practice, it is usually attached to `n`.

> A dog ran into the street. A car `car1` `n` (a blue one `car1` `n+fe`) stopped suddenly.

> Two cars `cars` `n`,
> [a blue] `car1` `n+fe` and [a white one] `car2` `n+fe`,
> stopped suddenly.

> Two cars `cars` `n` were driving down the road,
> with just one driver in each.
> The cars `cars` `g`,
> [a blue] `car1` `g+fe` and [a white one] `car2` `g+fe`,
> stopped suddenly.

## Predicative

Similar to Further Explanation, Predicative solves the issue with:

> There was a car `car1` `n`. It looked like a blue one `car1` `???`.

"a blue one" is tagged as `car1` `pr`.

Predicative referents generally come after one of these verbs:

* It was
* It looked like
* It seemed to be

Predicative referents do not introduce new referents, i.e. things or people; 
instead, they attribute a new characteristic to already existing referents, which were introduced 
before the verbs "to be", "to look like", "to seem like". Usually the already existing referents are 
a subject of those verbs.

Predicative referents are only tagged as `pr`.

> There was a car `car1` `n`.
> It `car2` `g` `subject` was a blue car `car1` `pr` `characteristic`.

As we see here, no new thing/person was introduced by the phrase "a blue car", it just added a new characteristic to `car1`.

> There were two cars `cars` `n`.
> The first car `car1` `g` `subject` was a blue car `car1` `pr` `characteristic`.

Similarly, "a blue car" does not introduce a new referent, but just adds a characteristic to an existing one.
