We use the ReFlex annotation scheme to give each new referent a referential label.
The original ReFlex paper can be found at https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/9028.

We use the following 9 labels:

| | R-Type | Abbreviation
|:-|-|-|
| 1 | New | `n` |
| 2 | Unused-Unknown | `u` |
| 3 | Bridging | `b` |
| 4 | Bridging-Contained | `bc` |
| 5 | Bridging-Displaced | `bd` |
| 6 | Given | `g` |
| 7 | Given-Displaced | `gd` |
| (8) | Further-Explanation | `+fe` |
| (9) | Predicative | `+pr` |

## New

A regular new referent, normally introduced with an indefinite article, referential "this", or a numeral.

> I saw [this man] `n` walking down the street and [a woman] `new` with a stroller.
> There were also [two cars] `n` coming.

> A woman `n` with a black dog `n` was loading groceries `n` into a minivan `n`.

Questions:

* [New vs. Unused-Unknown](#new-vs.-unused-unknown)

## Unused-Unknown

> “Assigned to referring expressions which come with a sufficient amount of descriptive material to enable the hearer to create a new discourse referent without any previous knowledge” (p. 4).

A new referent followed by explanation.
The explanation must be a part of the noun phrase containing the referent, and must include a specific non-new referent.

> I saw a man and a woman.
> The ball `unused-unknown` [that [the man] `g` was dribbling] `explanation` fell on the ground.

Untagged referents can appear in explanations.

> I was standing in the parking lot.
> The two cars `unused-unkown` [that were coming towards me `untagged` `g` very quickly] `explanation` stopped abruptly.

Referents preceded by possessive pronouns are also unused-unkown.
as long as the possessor is given or bridging.

> I saw a man `n` with his wife `u` and her baby `u`.

Referents preceded by apostrophe-s possession are *also* unused-unknown -
as long as the possessor is given or bridging.

> I saw a man walking down the street.
> The man['s wife] `u` was pushing a baby carriage.

> There was a car on the other side of the parking lot.
> A woman['s dog] `n` was barking loudly.

## Bridging

> “If an entity does not have a coreferential antecedent but can be understood as unique with respect to a previously introduced situation or scenario, we will be using the label r-bridging” (p. 4).

> “This label is used for non-coreferential anaphoric expressions which are dependent on and unique with respect to a previously introduced scenario” (p. 8).

In other words, we use this tag for referents that have not been explicitly introduced but are implied as an essential part of an already known referent (the anchor).

> There were two cars `n` `anchor` coming, and they crashed into each other.
> The drivers `b` got out and called the police.

> There was a family `n` `anchor` walking down the street.
> The father `b` was dribbling a ball.

"Father" is bridging because we know that if there is a family, there must be a father.
So, when "father" is introduced, you already implicitly know it's a member of that family.

The anchor need not be a tagged referent.
Any [bridging relationship](#bridging-relationships) is enough.

> I saw [a car crash] `untagged` `anchor`!
> The first car `b` stopped short, and the second `b` drove into it.

If a referent was bridging, you would expect it to be there, and be surprised if it did not exist.
For something that could be there, but isn’t necessarily (e.g. a woman’s groceries), use the unused-unknown.

Questions

* [What is a bridging relationship](#bridging-relationships)
* [Bridging vs. Bridging-Contained](#bridging-vs.-bridging-contained)

### Bridging-Contained

> "This label applies to a non-coreferential anaphoric expression that is anchored to an embedded phrase” (p. 8).

<!-- TODO: Link to Anchor -->
<!-- TODO: Link bridging relationship -->

Bridging-Contained is similar to Bridging, except that it requires the bridging referent to be in the same noun phrase as its anchor.

Examples:

> The driver `bc` of [the blue car] `anchor` ...

> The driver `bc` of [the closer car] `anchor` ...

> The father `bc` of [the family] `anchor` ...

> I saw a car crash!
> The driver `bc` who was in [the car] `anchor` `b` got out.

Since a car is expected to have a driver,
the driver is bridging-contained.

It is possible for the anchor of a bridging relationship to be the referent in a different bridging relationship:

> I saw [a car crash] `untagged` `n` `anchor: car1`!
> The man `driver1` `bc` who was in [the car] `car1` `anchor:driver1` `b` got out. 

In this example, "a car crash" acts as an anchor for "the car",
which in turn acts as an anchor for "the man".

### Bridging-Displaced

A Bridging-Displaced referent is a Bridging referent with 5 non-empty CU's between the CU containing the referent and the most recent CU containing its anchor.

> There was a couple `couple` `n` ... 
> [5 CU's] ... 
> The mother `woman1` `bd` was just standing there and didn't do anything

> A family `family` `n` was walking down the street.
> On the other side of the road, there was a woman.
> She was taking groceries out of her car.
> She was holding a dog on a leash.
> The dog saw a ball that rolled into the street.
> It barked and chased after the ball.
> The man `man` `bd` yelled and tried to stop the dog.

* [Which CU's are empty CU's?](#empty-cus)

## Given

<!-- TODO: Name for 'given-relationship conjoined referents' -->

A given referent is one that has been previously introduced, either as itself, or as part of a given-relationship conjoined referent.

> There was a man.
> He `g` was dribbling a ball.

> There were these two people walking.
> One `g` of them had a ball.

> There was a man who was dribbling a ball and a woman with a stroller.
> The two people `g` were crossing the street.

> There were two cars approaching the scene.
> The first car `g` stopped, and the second car `g` bumped into it.

Questions:

* [When a conjoined referent appears, are members of it treated as given or bridging?](#conjoined-referent-members)


### Given-Displaced

A Given-Displaced referent is a Given referent with 5 non-empty CU's between the CU containing the referent and the most recent CU containing the same referent.

> There was a man ...
> [ 5 CU’s ] ... 
> The man `gd` was running to catch the ball.

> A man and a woman were walking.
> There were two cars coming ...
> [ 5 CU’s ] ... 
> The man `gd` helped the lady with her groceries.

## Further-Explanation

Further Explanation was brought in to solve issues like the following:

> [Two cars] `cars` `n`, [a blue one] `car1` `???` and [a white one] `car2` `???`, were driving down the street.

In this example, it's difficult to determine the r-type of `car1` and `car2`.
They're introduced like new referents, leading us towards `n`, but then it would seem that `car1` was introduced twice -
once in `cars`, and once in `car1`.

To resolve this, we use the `+fe` tag.
`+fe` attaches to the end of the existing annotation, and we get:

* `cars` `n`
* `car1` `n+fe`
* `car2` `n+fe`

Theoretically, `+fe` can attach to any r-type. In practice, it is usually attached to `n`.

> A dog ran into the street. The first car `n` (the blue one `n+fe`) stopped suddenly.

> Two cars `cars` `n`, [a blue] `car1` `n+fe` and [a white one] `car2` `n+fe` stopped suddenly.

## Predicative

Similar to Further Explanation, Predicative solves the issue with:

> There was a car `car1` `n`. It looked like a blue one `car1` `???`.

"a blue one" is tagged as `car1` `pr`.

Predicative referents generally come after one of these verbs:

* It was
* It looked like
* It seemed to be

They attribute a certain characteristic to the subject of those verbs.

Predicative referents are only tagged as `pr`

> There were two cars.
> The first car `g` was a blue car `g+pr`.
