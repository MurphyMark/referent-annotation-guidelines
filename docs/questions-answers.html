<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Groceries</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What noun phrases should we tag as <code>groceries</code>? What noun phrases should we not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally, <code>groceries</code> should be a mass noun.
Here’s a list of things we’ve decided to tag as <code>groceries</code>, and a list of things we’ve decided not to.</p>
<p>Groceries:</p>
<ul>
<li>groceries</li>
<li>produce</li>
<li>shopping</li>
<li>stuff</li>
<li>food</li>
</ul>
<p>Not Groceries:</p>
<ul>
<li>bags</li>
<li>baggage</li>
<li>fruits</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="grocery-consistency" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Grocery Consistency</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What if someone introduces <code>groceries</code> as “fruits” <code>untagged</code>,
but then later refers to “her groceries” <code>tagged</code>?
Should we tag “fruits”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. The same is true of the reverse.
If “her groceries” appears, and “fruits” follows, we should tag both.</p>
</div>
<div id="family-vs.-couple" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3</span> Family vs. Couple</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the pronoun “they” refer to <code>family</code> or <code>couple</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>If all the members of the family have been introduced,
“they” refers to the family.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a man, a woman, and a baby.
They <code>family</code> crossed the street.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If only man and woman1 (and maybe stroller) have been introduced,
“they” refers to the couple, instead.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a man and a woman.
They <code>couple</code> crossed the street.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a man and a woman and a stroller.
They <code>couple</code> went across the street.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However: If there’s a man and a woman <em>with</em> a baby,
we treat it as a couple,
as the baby is just additional information
attached to the man or the woman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a man and a woman with a baby.
They <code>couple</code> crossed the street.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> Referent Explanations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What qualifies as an explanation?
How far does an explanation stretch?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An explanation is the material following a referent,
which explains how the referent is related to the narrative.</p>
<p>The width of the explanation depends on the type of noun phrase headed by the referent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple - The noun phrase ends after the referent</li>
</ul>
<p>If the noun phrase is simple, there is no explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other side of the street,
there was [a woman].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“a woman” ends with the referent, and has no explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other side of the street,
there was [a big tall woman].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“a big tall woman” ends with the referent, and has no explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other side of the street,
[a big tall woman], while loading groceries into her car,
also held back her dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“a big tall woman” ends with the referent, and has no explanation.
“while loading groceries into her car” might seem to explain the referent,
but it is not a part of the noun phrase headed by <code>woman2</code>,
and could even be moved around in the sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preposition - The noun phrase is extended with a prepositional phrase</li>
</ul>
<p>If the noun phrase is extended by a prepositional phrase,
the explanation continues until the end of the prepositional phrase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Across the street,
there was [a woman with a big, black, barking dog].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“with” introduces a prepositional phrase,
and the explanation continues until the end of that phrase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Across the street,
there was [a woman with a big blue car with an open trunk
and a dog who was trying to pull away from her].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“with” introduces a prepositional phrase,
and everything else in the sentence
is explaining the things that the woman is “with”.
So, everything else in the sentence is part of the explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Across the street,
[A woman with a big blue car whose trunk was open
and a dog on a leash who was trying to pull away from her],
while she was trying to hold onto the dog,
was also putting groceries into her car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“with” introduces a prepositional phrase,
and everything through “trying to pull away from her”
is explaining the things that <code>woman2</code> is “with”.</p>
<p>However, “while she was trying to hold onto the dog”
is not part of the noun phrase,
and could even be moved around in the sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Relative - The noun phrase is extended by a relative clause</li>
</ul>
<p>If the noun phrase is extended by a relative clause,
everything within that relative clause is part of the explanation.</p>
<p>Relative clauses start with words like “who”, “that”, or “which”,
or could have them inserted before the start of the clause.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Across the street,
there was [a woman who was pulling on her dog’s leash].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything after “a woman”
is part of a relative clause introduced with “who”,
and is part of the explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Across the street,
there was [a woman pulling on her dog’s leash].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything after “a woman” is part of a relative clause.
Although it is not introduced with “who”,
“who” could be inserted at the beginning of the clause.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Across the street,
[A woman putting groceries in a big blue car whose trunk was open,
and wrestling with a dog on a leash trying to pull away from her],
while she was trying to hold onto the dog,
was also putting groceries into her car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the relative clause starts with “putting groceries …”,
and ends with “… away from her”.
If we inserted “who was” at the start of the relative clause,
it would still make sense.</p>
<p>“while she …” is a subordinate clause, and not part of the noun phrase.
While the relative clause cannot be moved around in the sentence,
this subordinate clause can be.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.5</span> Bridging Relationships</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a bridging relationship?
What are some referents with bridging relationships?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two referents have a bridging relationship
when introducing one implies the other.</p>
<p>If all the referents on one side of a bridging relationship are introduced,
you would expect the referents on the other side to exist also,
and would not be surprised if they appeared in the narrative.</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of bridging relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>man, woman &lt;-&gt; couple</li>
<li>man, woman, baby &lt;-&gt; family</li>
<li>baby &lt;-&gt; stroller</li>
<li>drivers &lt;-&gt; cars</li>
<li>car3 &lt;-&gt; trunk</li>
<li>dog &lt;-&gt; leash</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A woman was holding back her dog <code>dog</code> <code>u</code> <code>anchor:leash</code>,
but it kept pulling on the leash <code>leash</code> <code>b</code> she was using.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have made the decision that bridging relationships work in both directions.
This decision can be reviewed in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a woman putting groceries into her trunk <code>trunk</code> <code>n</code> <code>anchor:car3</code>.
She was loading them very quickly into the back of [the car] <code>car3</code> <code>b</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A woman was holding a bright pink leash <code>leash</code> <code>n</code> <code>anchor:dog</code> very tightly,
but the dog <code>dog</code> <code>b</code> kept pulling anyway.</p>

<p>I saw a lady, and [a boy] next to her bouncing a ball.</p>

<p><code>man</code> - <code>u</code></p>
<p>“a boy” is slightly confusing,

<p>Neither is tagged.</p>
<p>There is no single owner of two cars.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The two people came out of their cars and [a man] with the white shirt called the police.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>driver</code> - <code>g</code></p>
<p>We know that driver1 called the police,
so we can assume that’s who they were referring to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[They] both came out, and [one of them] called the police</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“They”: <code>drivers</code> - <code>g</code></p>
<p>“One of them”: <code>driver1</code> - <code>g</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>… which distracted a dog that was in the road behind [a car].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Untagged</p>
<p>“a car” is unlikely to be <code>car3</code>,

<p>There were no passengers in the cars.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The car behind him was coming after him,
so [he] crashed into [that car] too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both untagged</p>
<p>“that car” has to refer to “the car behind him”, which is <code>car2</code>.
Because of this, “he” must refer to <code>driver1</code>,
but <code>driver1</code> and <code>car1</code> were crashed into by <code>driver2</code> and <code>car2</code>.

<blockquote>
<p>EXMARaLDA has too many tiers. Can I hide some?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! To hide tiers in Exmaralda, without deleting them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a tier on the left, or use shift-click to select multiple tiers</li>
<li>In the top menu, go to Tier &gt; Hide Tier</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.6.2</span> Merge Cells</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a way to merge cells and immediately begin typing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.
If you use the merge-cells button, you have to click on the merged cell to type into it.
However, if you instead use the merge-cells shortcut (ctrl-1 on Windows), you can immediately begin typing in the merged cell.</p>
