What phrases should we not? Generally, groceries should be a mass noun. Here’s a list of things we’ve decided to tag as groceries, and a list of things we’ve decided not to. Groceries: groceries produce shopping stuff food Not Groceries: bags baggage fruits 5.1.2 Family vs. Couple Is this group of people family or couple ? Generally, if all the members of the family have been introduced, they refers to the family. If only man and woman1 (and maybe stroller) have been introduced, they refers to the couple, instead. Also: if there’s a man and a woman with a baby, we treat it as a couple, as the baby is just additional information about either the man or the woman. There was a man, a woman, and a baby. They family crossed the street. There was a man and a woman. They couple crossed the street. There was a man and a woman and a stroller. They couple went across the street. There was a man and a woman with a baby. They couple crossed the street. 5.1.3 Possessive Pronoun “whose” How do we tag “whose” in referent noun phrases such as “There was a woman whose car …” Tag “whose” as part of the referent that comes after. There was a woman [whose car] u was very spacious. 5.1.4 Repititions What do we do with repeated references (“A ball - a ball was rolling …”)? If a referent was repeated, tag only the last referent - the one the speaker eventually decided on. A man untagged was, a man n was walking down the street. 5.1.5 Identifying Repititions Does this example contain a repitition? Here are some previous questions about repitions, and our decisions. The referents in question are marked with [] brackets: A woman was closing [her trunk], opening [it], and … Tag both referents normally. The car behind him - hit [it] also - hit [the car] - [the other car] Tag only “the other car”. And the guy with [the ball] who accidentally dropped [the ball] … Tag only the second “the ball”. 5.1.6 Tagging Unclear Referents How confusing can a description be before we decide not to tag the referent? Here are some examples, and our decisions. The referents in question are marked with [] brackets: I saw a lady, and [a boy] next to her bouncing a ball. man - u … so the [owner] of [the cars] called 911. Neither is tagged, because there is no single owner of two cars. The two people came out of their cars and [a man] with the white shirt called the police. driver - g [They] both came out, and [one of them] called the police “They”: drivers - g “One of them”: driver1 - g I think [someone] like called 911 drivers The man helped the woman. Uh, [she] helped her pick up her groceries. man … which distracted a dog that was in the road behind [a car]. Untagged [The passengers] got out and called the police. Untagged The car behind him was coming after him, so [he] crashed into [that car] too. Both untagged 5.1.7 Generic Referents Is this referent generic, and should we tag it? Here are some examples, and our decisions: The woman was holding her dog by [the leash]. leash - b Both drivers got out of [the car] Untagged 5.1.8 Aposotrophe S What do we do with ’s phrases, like “the man’s ball”? Normally when you see an apostrophe s, you can break the phrase up into a given and an unused-unknown. However, if there is a bridging relationship between the two members of the phrase, the second member might be bridging-contained instead. This requires a bridging relationship, though, and most apostrophe s’s will be unused-unknown. A woman was getting her groceries. The woman g [‘s dog] u ran into the road. A car pulled over. The car g [‘s driver] bc got out, and started yelling. 5.1.9 Possessive Pronouns What do we do with phrases containing possessive pronouns (his ball)? Possessive pronoun phrases are either unused-unknown or bridging (never bridging-contained). If there is a bridging relationship, then bridging. Otherwise unused-unknown. A woman was in the parking lot. [Her groceries] u fell. One of the drivers stopped suddenly. [ Their car ] b screeched really loud. 5.1.10 Wh-Words and Possessive Pronouns Should we tag wh-words or possessive pronouns that are not attached to a referent? Nope! Only personal pronouns and referent phrases should be tagged. A man n was in the parking lot. He g was happy. A man n was in the parking lot. In his untagged hand was [his ball] u. There was a woman. The man u who untagged was with her looked confused. 5.1.11 Conjoined Referents When a conjoined referent appears, are members of it treated as given or bridging? Also, when members of a conjoined referent appear, is the conjoined referent treated as given or bridging? If the conjoined referent is just the collection of individual referents, members are treated as given. If all members have been previously listed, the conjoined referent is given, too. Given relationship conjoined referents: cars drivers If the conjoined referent has some inferred bridging relationship between it and its members, members are treated as bridging. If all members have been previously listed, the conjoined referent is bridging. However, if the conjoined referent is introduced in a way that enumerates the members (“Two people were walking down the street”), introduced members are treated as Given. Bridging relationship conjoined referents: couple family A red car and a blue car drove down the street. The cars g were going way too fast. Two cars were driving down the street. The red one g was going slow. One car’s driver got out. Then the other car’s driver got out. The drivers g started arguing. The drivers got out of the car. The first driver g looked very angry. Two people were walking down the street. One of them g was bouncing a ball. A man and a woman were standing around. The couple b was holding hands. A couple was standing in the parking lot. The husband b was looking around. A man, a woman, and a baby were standing in the parking lot. The family b looked happy. A family was walking down the street. The baby b was crying. 5.2 R-Types 5.2.1 New vs. Unused-Unknown Should I tag this referent as New or Unused-Unknown? Tag as u if: The predicate contains a given referent The predicate contains a bridging or unused-unknown referent Otherwise, tag as n. 5.2.2 Phrases Containing Given Referents Does this phrase contain a given referent? A phrase contains a given referent if: There is an annotated referent marked g There is a non-annotated referent that has been previously introduced Examples: The man who was holding the ball g and talking to a woman dropped it. Phrase: “who was holding the ball” “the ball”: Given “a woman”: New Phrase contains a given referent The man who was holding a ball n dropped it. Phrase: “who was holding a ball” “a ball”: New Phrase does not contain a given referent The man with the woman g ’s ball u dropped it. Phrase: “with the woman’s ball” “the woman”: Given “’s ball”: Unused-Unknown Phrase contains a given referent A couple was walking down the road. A woman across the street was unloading groceries from her car. Phrase: “across the street” “the street”: Given Phrase contains a given referent Note: Although “the street” is not annotated, it has been introduced in the narrative. So, it is considered a given referent. A couple was walking with a stroller. A woman across the street was unloading groceries from her car. Phrase: “across the street” “the street”: New Phrase does not contain a given referent 5.2.3 Bridging vs. Bridging-Contained Should I tag this referent as Bridging or Bridging-Contained? Simalar to unused-unknown, tag as bc if either: The anchor of the referent appears in the same phrase as the referent The referent is a part of a possessive phrase with the anchor A child was walking down the street. The father bc of the child was following close behind. Two cars stopped in the street. The first car [’s driver] bc got out angrily. The first car stopped in the street. The driver b got out angrily. Since this example doesn’t have “the first car” in the same phrase as “the driver”, it is not Bridging-Contained. 5.2.4 Possessive Pronoun Multiple Referents Can a possessive pronoun give unused-unknown status to multiple coordinated referents? Yes, if the possessive pronoun applies to a coordinated noun phrase, all referents in that noun phrase are unused-unknown. There was a woman with [her dog] u and groceries u. 5.2.5 Counting CU’s How do we count the 5 CU’s between a referent and its most recent co-referent/anchor An r-type is -Displaced if there are 5 CU’s between the CU containing the referent and the CU containing its most recent co-referent/anchor. The count of CU’s should exclude empty CU’s. 5.2.6 Empty CU’s Which CU’s are empty CU’s? Empty CU’s are those without words - pauses, tongue clicks, gulping, etc. 5.2.7 Introductions 5.3 Conjoined Referents 5.3.1 Explaining Conjoined Referent Pronouns If a pronoun refers to a conjoined referent (“The two cars stopped. [They] didn’t stop fast enough”), should we mark whether or not it’s explained? Yep. It’s possible, for someone to explain a conjoined referent, even if it’s a pronoun, so we’ll just mark all conjoined referents. There was a family walking down the street. They family g 1, a man, a woman, and a child, were walking quickly. 5.4 Phrases 5.4.1 One Behind The Other Does thre phrase “one behind the other” have any referents? No. We are treating “one behind the other” as an idiom, so it has no referents. 5.4.2 Everyone Which referent does “everyone” refer to? Here are some previous questions about “everyone”, and our decisions: The car hit into the back of another car. Everyone seemed fine. Untagged The man checked with everyone involved in the accident. drivers [Everybody] got out and [they] were talking. drivers for both … then [everybody] got out and was yelling. drivers 5.4.3 Either/Neither/None of the What do we do with “Either / Neither / None of the [ conjoined referent ]” ? Since either, neither, and none don’t really refer to a concrete referent, we will not tag the phrase, and we will not tag any referents within the phrase. None of the family untagged looked very happy. Neither of the drivers untagged was at fault. Either one of them untagged could have ended the fight. 5.4.4 Both of the What do we do with “Both of the [ conjoined referent ]” ? This phrase refers to the conjoined referent. Tag the whole phrase, and tag it with whatever the conjoined referent would be on its own. The two cars stopped. [Both of the drivers] drivers b got out. [Both of the people] couple u who had been walking down the street looked shocked. 5.4.5 One of the What do we do with “One of the [conjoined referent]” ? This phrase refers to a single member of the conjoined referent. If the context gives evidence that it is one or the other of the members, tag the whole phrase as that member. If there is no evidence to the identity of the referent, treat it like other ambiguous referents, and do not tag it. The white car g crashed into the blue car g. One of the drivers driver b got out and called the police. We know that the referent is driver1, because driver1 is the one who calls the police in this scenario. We know that the referent is bridging, because driver1 has a bridging relationship with the blue car. The two drivers g crashed into each other. One of them untagged looked upset. Both drivers could be described as looking upset. Since we don’t know which driver the phrase refers to, we don’t tag anything in the phrase. 5.4.6 Each Other Should we tag “each other” ? Nope. 5.5 Technical 5.5.1 Hide Tiers EXMARaLDA has too many tiers. Can I hide some? Yes!
