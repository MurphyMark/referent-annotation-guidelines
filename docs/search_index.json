["answer-2-r-type.html", "3 Answer 2: R-Type 3.1 R-Type 3.2 New 3.3 Unused-Unknown 3.4 Bridging 3.5 Given", " 3 Answer 2: R-Type 3.1 R-Type Annotated on tier norm[r-type] in ExMARALDA We use the ReFlex annotation scheme to give each new referent a referential label. The original ReFlex paper can be found at https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/9028. We use the following 7 labels: R-Type Abbreviation 1 New n 2 Unused-Unknown u 3 Bridging b 4 Bridging-Contained bc 5 Bridging-Displaced bd 6 Given g 7 Given-Displaced gd 3.2 New A regular new referent, normally introduced with an indefinite article, referential “this”, or a numeral. I saw [this man] new walking down the street and [a woman] new with a stroller. There were also [two cars] new coming. A woman new with a black dog new was loading groceries new into a minivan new. Questions: New vs. Unused-Unknown 3.3 Unused-Unknown “Assigned to referring expressions which come with a sufficient amount of descriptive material to enable the hearer to create a new discourse referent without any previous knowledge” (p. 4). A new referent followed by explanation. The explanation must be a part of the noun phrase containing the referent, and must include a specific non-new referent. I saw a man and a woman. The ball unused-unknown that the man was dribbling fell on the ground. I was standing in the parking lot. The two cars unused-unkown that were coming towards me stopped abruptly. Referents preceded by possessive pronouns are also unused-unkown. I saw a man new with his wife unused-unknown and her baby unused-unknown. 3.4 Bridging “If an entity does not have a coreferential antecedent but can be understood as unique with respect to a previously introduced situation or scenario, we will be using the label r-bridging” (p. 4). “This label is used for non-coreferential anaphoric expressions which are dependent on and unique with respect to a previously introduced scenario” (p. 8). In other words, we use this tag for referents that have not been explicitly introduced but are implied as an essential part of an already known referent (the anchor). If a referent was bridging, you would expect it to be there, and be surprised if it did not exist. For something that could be there, but isn’t necessarily (e.g. a woman’s groceries), use the unused-unknown. There were two cars new coming, and they crashed into each other. The drivers bridging got out and called the police. There was a family new walking down the street. The father bridging was dribbling a ball. “Father” is bridging because we know that if there is a family, there must be a father. So, when “father” is introduced, you already implicitly know it’s a member of that family. I saw a car crash! The first car bridging stopped short, and the second bridging drove into it. Questions Bridging vs. Bridging-Contained 3.4.1 Bridging-Contained “This label applies to a non-coreferential anaphoric expression that is anchored to an embedded phrase” (p. 8). Briding-Contained is similar to Unused-Unknown, except that it requires the anchor of a bridging relationship in the same phrase, not just an introduced referent. Examples: The driver bc of the blue car … The driver bc of the closer car … The father bc of the family … I saw a car crash! The driver bc who was in the car b got out. Since a car is expected to have a driver, the driver is bridging-contained. I saw a car crash! The man bc who was in the car b got out. Questions: Bridging vs. Bridging-Contained 3.4.2 Bridging-Displaced A Bridging-Displaced referent is a Bridging referent with 5 non-empty CU’s between the CU containing the referent and the most recent CU containing its anchor. There was a couple … [5 CU’s] … The mother was just standing there and didn’t do anything Questions: 3.5 Given A given referent is one that has been previously introduced, either as itself, or as part of a given-relationship conjoined referent. There was a man. He g was dribbling a ball. There were these two people walking. One g of them had a ball. There were two cars approaching the scene. The first car given stopped, and the second car given bumped into it. There was a man who was dribbling a ball and a woman with a stroller. The couple given was crossing the street. Questions: 3.5.1 Given-Displaced A Given-Displaced referent is a Given referent with 5 non-empty CU’s between the CU containing the referent and the most recent CU containing the same referent. There was a man … [ 5 CU’s ] … The man gd was running to catch the ball. A man and a woman were walking. There were two cars coming … [ 5 CU’s ] … The man gd helped the lady with her groceries.
