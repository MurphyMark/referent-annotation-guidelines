# Research Questions

1. Do heratige speakers introduce more referents than monolinguals?

2. Do heratige speakers use different types of referents than monolinguals?

3. Do heratige speakers explain conjoined referents more often than monolinguals?

# Answer 1: Referents

## Referents

(Annotated on tier `norm[referent]` in ExMARALDA)

We have a list of 20 possible referents, and we count how many of these 20 referents each speaker introduces:

1. man (with the ball)
2. woman1 (with the stroller)
3. couple (man and woman1) - *conjoined referent*
4. people (all the people in the parking lot) - *conjoined referent*
5. family (man+woman1+baby) - *conjoined referent*
6. ball
7. stroller
8. baby
9. woman2 (with the dog)
10. dog
11. leash
12. groceries
13. trunk
14. car1 (blue one, comes in first, gets hit)
15. car2 (white one, comes in second, hits car1)
16. car3 (red one, woman with groceries)
17. cars (car1 + car2) - *conjoined referent*
18. driver1 (blue car, calls 911)
19. driver2 (white car)
20. drivers (driver1 + driver2) - *conjoined referent*

# Answer 2: R-Type

<!-- TODO: Abbreviations for examples -->

## R-Type

<!-- TODO: More systematic r-type examples -->

> Annotated on tier `norm[r-type]` in ExMARALDA

We use the ReFlex annotation scheme to give each new referent a referential label.
The original ReFlex paper can be found at https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/9028.

We use the following 7 labels:

| | R-Type | Abbreviation
|:-|-|-|
| 1 | New | `n` |
| 2 | Unused-Unknown | `u` |
| 3 | Bridging | `b` |
| 4 | Bridging-Contained | `bc` |
| 5 | Bridging-Displaced | `bd` |
| 6 | Given | `g` |
| 7 | Given-Displaced | `gd` |

<!-- TODO: ADD EXPLANATION FOR FE & PR -->


<!-- TODO: Standardize explanation style -->
<!-- TODO: Standardize examples - tagging non-target r-types -->

## New

A regular new referent, normally introduced with an indefinite article, referential "this", or a numeral.

> I saw [this man] `new` walking down the street and [a woman] `new` with a stroller.
> There were also [two cars] `new` coming.

> A woman `new` with a black dog `new` was loading groceries `new` into a minivan `new`.

<!-- TODO: Bracket all annotations? Seems non-scalable w/ multiple annotations -->

<!-- TODO: Definitions link -->
Questions:

* [New vs. Unused-Unknown](#new-vs.-unused-unknown)

## Unused-Unknown

> “Assigned to referring expressions which come with a sufficient amount of descriptive material to enable the hearer to create a new discourse referent without any previous knowledge” (p. 4).

<!-- TODO: CHECK ON THE SPECIFICS OF UNUSED-UKNOWN -->
A new referent followed by explanation.
The explanation must be a part of the noun phrase containing the referent, and must include a specific non-new referent.

> I saw a man and a woman.
> The ball `unused-unknown` that the man was dribbling fell on the ground.

<!-- TODO: IS THIS EXAMPLE TRUE? -->
> I was standing in the parking lot.
> The two cars `unused-unkown` that were coming towards me stopped abruptly.

Referents preceded by possessive pronouns are also unused-unkown.

<!-- TODO: IS "HER BABY" U OR N? -->
> I saw a man `new` with his wife `unused-unknown` and her baby `unused-unknown`.


## Bridging

> “If an entity does not have a coreferential antecedent but can be understood as unique with respect to a previously introduced situation or scenario, we will be using the label r-bridging” (p. 4).

> “This label is used for non-coreferential anaphoric expressions which are dependent on and unique with respect to a previously introduced scenario” (p. 8).

In other words, we use this tag for referents that have not been explicitly introduced but are implied as an essential part of an already known referent (the anchor).

If a referent was bridging, you would expect it to be there, and be surprised if it did not exist.
For something that could be there, but isn’t necessarily (e.g. a woman’s groceries), use the unused-unknown.

> There were two cars `new` coming, and they crashed into each other.
> The drivers `bridging` got out and called the police.

> There was a family `new` walking down the street.
> The father `bridging` was dribbling a ball.

"Father" is bridging because we know that if there is a family, there must be a father.
So, when "father" is introduced, you already implicitly know it's a member of that family.

> I saw a car crash! The first car `bridging` stopped short, and the second `bridging` drove into it.

Questions

* [Bridging vs. Bridging-Contained](#bridging-vs.-bridging-contained)

### Bridging-Contained

> "This label applies to a non-coreferential anaphoric expression that is anchored to an embedded phrase” (p. 8).

<!-- TODO: Link to Anchor -->
<!-- TODO: Link bridging relationship -->

Briding-Contained is similar to Unused-Unknown, except that it requires the anchor of a bridging relationship in the same phrase, not just an introduced referent.

<!-- TODO: talk about bridging-relationship in bc examples -->

Examples:

> The driver `bc` of the blue car ...

> The driver `bc` of the closer car ...

> The father `bc` of the family ...

> I saw a car crash! The driver `bc` who was in the car `b` got out.

Since a car is expected to have a driver, the driver is bridging-contained.

> I saw a car crash! The man `bc` who was in the car `b` got out.

### Bridging-Displaced

A Bridging-Displaced referent is a Bridging referent with 5 non-empty CU's between the CU containing the referent and the most recent CU containing its anchor.

> There was a couple ... 
> [5 CU's] ... 
> The mother was just standing there and didn't do anything

Questions:
<!-- TODO: What qualifies as a non-empty CU -->

## Given

<!-- TODO: Name for 'given-relationship conjoined referents' -->

A given referent is one that has been previously introduced, either as itself, or as part of a given-relationship conjoined referent.

> There was a man.
> He `g` was dribbling a ball.

> There were these two people walking.
> One `g` of them had a ball.

> There were two cars approaching the scene.
> The first car `given` stopped, and the second car `given` bumped into it.

> There was a man who was dribbling a ball and a woman with a stroller.
> The couple `given` was crossing the street.

# Answer 3: Conjoined Referents

<!--chapter:end:02-conjoined-referents.Rmd-->

# Questions & Answers

## Referents

### Possessive Pronoun "whose"

> How do we tag "whose" in referent noun phrases such as "There was a woman whose car ..."

Tag "whose" as part of the referent that comes after.

> There was a woman [whose car] `u` was very spacious.

### Identifying Repititions

<!-- Add to 00-referents -->
> Does this example contain a repitition?

Here are some previous questions about repitions, and our decisions.
The referents in question are marked with `[]` brackets:

> A woman was closing [her trunk], opening [it], and ...

Tag both referents normally.

> The car behind him - hit [it] also - hit [the car] - [the other car]

Tag only "the other car".

> And the guy with [the ball] who accidentally dropped [the ball] ...

Tag only the second "the ball".

### Tagging Unclear Referents

<!-- Add to 00-referents -->
> How confusing can a description be before we decide not to tag the referent?

Here are some examples, and our decisions.
The referents in question are marked with `[]` brackets:

> I saw a lady, and [a boy] next to her bouncing a ball.

`man` - `u`

> ... so the [owner] of [the cars] called 911.

Neither is tagged, because there is no single owner of two cars.

> The two people came out of their cars and [a man] with the white shirt called the police.

`driver` - `g`

> [They] both came out, and [one of them] called the police

"They": `drivers` - `g`

"One of them": `driver1` - `g`

> I think [someone] like called 911

`drivers`

> The man helped the woman. Uh, [she] helped her pick up her groceries.

`man`

> ... which distracted a dog that was in the road behind [a car].

Untagged

> [The passengers] got out and called the police.

Untagged

> The car behind him was coming after him, so [he] crashed into [that car] too.

Both untagged

## R-Types

### New vs. Unused-Unknown

> Should I tag this referent as New or Unused-Unknown?

Tag as `u` if:

<!-- TODO: predicate? How to call the other parts of NP? -->
<!-- TODO: How to call previously-introduced referents? -->
* The predicate contains a [given referent](#phrases-containing-given-referents)
* The predicate contains a bridging or unused-unknown referent

<!-- TODO: tag 'the back of the car' as u -->
<!-- TODO: Tag "the woman's dog" as u -->

Otherwise, tag as `n`.

#### Examples

<!-- TODO: Examples -->


### Phrases Containing Given Referents

<!-- TODO: Name, update links -->

> Does this phrase contain a given referent?

A phrase contains a given referent if:

* There is an annotated referent marked `g`

* There is a non-annotated referent that has been previously introduced

Examples:

<!--
* `g` referent => Y
* `n` referent => N
* `u` referent => N
* given un-annotated => Y
* non-given un-annotated => N

Phrase types:
* relative clause
* prepositional phrase
-->

<!-- TODO: Other phrase types ? -->

> The man who was holding the ball `g` and talking to a woman dropped it.

Phrase: "who was holding the ball"

"the ball": Given

"a woman": New

Phrase contains a given referent

> The man who was holding a ball `n` dropped it.

Phrase: "who was holding a ball"

"a ball": New

Phrase does not contain a given referent

<!-- TODO: "The man who was holding the woman's ball -->
> The man with the woman `g` 's ball `u` dropped it.

Phrase: "with the woman's ball"

"the woman": Given

"'s ball": Unused-Unknown

Phrase contains a given referent

<!-- TODO: Does sidewalk == street? -->

> A couple was walking down the road.
> A woman across the street was unloading groceries from her car.

Phrase: "across the street"

"the street": Given

Phrase contains a given referent

Note: Although "the street" is not annotated, it has been introduced in the narrative.
So, it is considered a given referent.

> A couple was walking with a stroller.
> A woman across the street was unloading groceries from her car.

Phrase: "across the street"

"the street": New

Phrase does not contain a given referent

### Bridging vs. Bridging-Contained

> Should I tag this referent as Bridging or Bridging-Contained?

<!-- TODO: "predicate" ? -->
<!-- TODO: Link `anchor` -->
<!-- TODO: Possessive phrase phrasing -->
Simalar to [unused-unknown](#new-vs.-unused-unknown), tag as `bc` if:

* The anchor of the referent appears in the predicate

* The referent is a part of a possessive phrase with the anchor

#### Examples
<!-- TODO: Examples -->

### Possessive Pronoun Multiple Referents

<!-- link possessive-pronoun & unused-unknown -->
> Can a possessive pronoun give unused-unknown status to multiple coordinated referents?

Yes, if the possessive pronoun applies to a coordinated noun phrase, all referents in that noun phrase are unused-unknown.

> There was a woman with [her dog] `u` and [groceries] `u`.


### Counting CU's

> How do we count the 5 CU's between a referent and its most recent co-referent/anchor

An r-type is `-Displaced` if there are 5 CU's *between* the CU containing the referent and the CU containing its most recent co-referent/anchor.

The count of CU's should exclude [empty CU's](empty-cu's).

### Empty CU's

> Which CU's are empty CU's?

Empty CU's are those without words - pauses, tongue clicks, gulping, etc.

<!-- TODO: Add examples -->
<!-- TODO: What about "hmm" -->

### Introductions
